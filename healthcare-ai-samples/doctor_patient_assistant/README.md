# Doctor-Patient Interaction Assistant

This sample demonstrates how to:
- Transcribe doctor-patient conversations using Azure Speech-to-Text.
- Label speakers (doctor/patient).
- Generate clinical notes using Azure OpenAI.

## Contents
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step code.
- `mock_audio.wav`: Sample audio file (placeholder).

## Setup
1. Get Azure Speech and OpenAI API keys (see main_README.md).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook.

## Notes
- The notebook uses mock data for demo purposes.
- Replace API keys and endpoints with your own.
