# Healthcare Summarization & Chronic Disease Prediction

This sample demonstrates how to:
- Summarize healthcare records using Azure Text Analytics/OpenAI.
- Predict chronic disease risk using Azure ML (mocked in notebook).

## Contents
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step code.
- `mock_data.csv`: Sample healthcare data (placeholder).

## Setup
1. Get Azure Text Analytics and OpenAI API keys (see main_README.md).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook.

## Notes
- The notebook uses mock data for demo purposes.
- Replace API keys and endpoints with your own.
