# Healthcare AI All-in-One

This repository contains two easy-to-use healthcare AI projects:

1. **Healthcare AI Samples** (doctor-patient assistant, healthcare summarization, prediction)
2. **Virtual Healthcare Dashboard** (modern web dashboard)

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside?

- `healthcare-ai-samples/` ‚Äî Simple tools and notebooks for:
  - Transcribing doctor-patient conversations
  - Generating clinical notes with AI
  - Summarizing health records and predicting chronic disease
- `virtual-healthcare-dashboard/` ‚Äî A modern dashboard web app with:
  - Chat-style consultation
  - Patient summaries, risk scores, and history
  - Beautiful, interactive interface

# üöÄ How to Use (Step-by-Step)

## 1. Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Node.js and npm (for dashboard)
- pip (Python package installer)

## 2. Install Everything
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
# Go to this folder
cd /Users/astha/CascadeProjects/healthcare-ai-all

# Install Python dependencies for all tools
cd healthcare-ai-samples
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../virtual-healthcare-dashboard/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Try the Doctor-Patient Assistant (Streamlit)
```bash
cd ../../healthcare-ai-samples/doctor_patient_assistant
streamlit run app.py
```
- Opens in your browser at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## 4. Try the Dashboard (Modern Web App)
```bash
cd ../../virtual-healthcare-dashboard/backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
# In a new terminal:
cd ../frontend
npm install  # (first time only)
npm start
```
- Opens in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 5. Try the Notebooks
```bash
# For doctor-patient assistant:
cd ../../healthcare-ai-samples/doctor_patient_assistant
jupyter notebook
# For summarization/prediction:
cd ../../healthcare-ai-samples/healthcare_summarization_prediction
jupyter notebook
```

## 6. API Keys
- For real results, add your Azure Speech and OpenAI API keys where prompted.
- You can use mock data for demo/testing.
